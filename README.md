Speed Detector Challenge
This is a simple  problem that simulates a speed detector for cars. The program takes the speed of a car as input and determines if the car is within the speed limit. If the car speed is less than 70 km/h, it prints "Ok." However, if the car speed exceeds the speed limit, the program calculates the number of demerit points for the driver. The rule is that for every 5 km/h above the speed limit, the driver gets one demerit point.

How to Use
Enter the speed of the car in the input field provided.
Click the "Check Speed" button to see the result.
Speed Limits and Demerit Points
Speed Limit: 70 km/h
Excess Speed (above 70 km/h): For every 5 km/h above the speed limit, the driver gets one demerit point.
Example
If the user enters a car speed of 80 km/h, the program will calculate the excess speed as 80 km/h - 70 km/h = 10 km/h. Since 10 km/h is equivalent to 2 intervals of 5 km/h above the speed limit, the driver will get 2 demerit points. The program will display "Points: 2".

If the user enters a car speed of 90 km/h, the app will calculate the excess speed as 90 km/h - 70 km/h = 20 km/h. Since 20 km/h is equivalent to 4 intervals of 5 km/h above the speed limit, the driver will get 4 demerit points. The program will display "Points: 4".

If the driver accumulates more than 12 demerit points, the app will show "License suspended."
